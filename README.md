# Video Chat with WebRTC and Firebase

Build a 1-to-1 video chat feature with WebRTC, Firestore, and JavaScript. 

This application was built with the guidance of fireship.io using firebase as back end and WebRTC to communicate and establish connection between the clients to achieve a connection for the video chat.

I HOPE YOU FIND THIS USEFUL!
